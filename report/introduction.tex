\chapter{Introduction}

To get hands on experience with decentralized applications a Lottery system was
implemented. The requirements were the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The lottery system must run entirely within one or more Smart
    Contracts (SC).
    \item For determining a winner a random number generator oracle must be
    implemented an run in a separate SC than the lottery. Though, the random
    numbers can be generated either on the blockchain or externally.
    \item The lottery SC must automatically pay the prize to the winner, divide
    the prize in case of multiple winners, or accumulate the prize for the next
    lottery round in case of no winners. 
\end{itemize}

The lottery was realized on the Ethereum blockchain with the Solidity
programming language. Furthermore, a front-end for convenient interaction with
the lottery was implemented using JavaScript and React\footnote{\url{https://reactjs.org/}}. 

The source code of the implementation as well as the sources for this report can
